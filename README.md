ITIL 4 foundation study notes

##ITIL 4 Core Concept

SVS - service value system
* service management basis
* creating value
* service relationship model

ITIL 4 Backbone framework
* Focus on value
    * understand and identify the service consumer
    * understand the consumer perspective of use
    * map value to intended outcomes, which change over time
    * Understand the customer experience
* Start where you are
    * Look at what exists
    * Determine if successful practices/services can be replicated
    * Apply risk management skills in decision making
    * Recognize that you might need to start fresh, but don’t be reinvent the real
* Progress Iteratively with Feedback
    * Comprehend the whole but do something
    * The ecosystem is constantly changing, use feedback
    * Fast does not mean incomplete, always have minimum in the whole components
* Collaborate and Promote Visibility
    * collaboration does not mean consensus
    * Communicate in a way the audience can hear
    * Decisions can only be made on visible data, don’t guess
* Think and Work Holistically
    * Recognize the complexity of the systems
    * Collaboration is key to working holistically
    * Look for patterns between system elements when possible
    * Automation can facilitate holistic work
* Keep It Simple and Practical
    * Ensure value
    * Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication
    * Do fewer thins bu do them better
    * Respect the time of the people involved
    * Easier to understand, easier to adopt
* Optimize and Automate
    * Simplify and/or optimize before automating
    * Define your metrics
    * Understand and agree to the context for the optimization

The guiding principle with value co-creation
- Know how service consumers use each service
- Encourage a focus on value among all staff
- Include focus on value in every step of improvement 
- Focus on value even in daily operations

The 4 dimensions of Service Management
* Dimension value system
    * Provides effective and efficient facilitation of value to customer
    * Represents perspectives that are relevant to the whole SVS
    * Understands the constraints placed upon SVS by external factors outside their control
* 4 Dimensions of Service Management - Products and services Value
    * 1 - Organisation and people
    * 2 - Information and technology
    * 3 - Partners and suppliers
    * 4 - Value streams and processes
* Factors
    * Every dimension is affected by multiple factors
* Working with the 4 Dimensions
    * Organization and people
        * Roles, responsibilities, and system of organization should be well-defined
        * Communication should support the overall strategy of the organization
        * you need a strong culture as well as structure to make it work
        * every person in the organization needs to have a clear understanding of their contribution to success
    * Information and technology
        * Information
            * what information is managed by services
            * what supporting information and knowledge are needed to deliver and manage the services
            * how will the information and knowledge assist be protected, managed, archived, and dispose of 
        * Technology
            * is the technology compatible current architecture ? 
            * what about regulatory or other compliance issues with the organizations policies ? 
            * is the technology viable for the foreseeable future
            * does the technology align with the strategy of the service providers and customers
            * do you have the right skill sets to operate and maintain the technology
        * Example : Cloud computing
            * On-demand availability
            * network access
            * resource polling
            * rapid elasticity

            * What actives do we undertake and how are they organized efficient ? 
        * Value stream
            * A series of steps an organization understates to create an deliver products and services es to consumers
        * Process
            * a particular set of activities that transforming puts to output, process describe what is done to accomplish an objective. They are usually detailed in procedures, which outline who is involved and the work instructions necessary to accomplish the outputs.

##ITIL 4 Service Value System

Overview of Service Value System (SVS)
* the SVS describes how all the components and actives of the organization work together as a system to enable value creation
    * Component and activity of an organization
    * Create value
* ITIL SVS about flexibility 
* Service Value System
    * Guiding principles
    * Governance
    * Service Value Chain
    * Practices
    * Continual Improvement
* Challenges
    * Organizational silos
    * Adapting to Agile methodologies
    * Understanding continual improvement
    * Understanding how to use the guiding principles
* The core concepts of Value
    * Value - the perceived benefits, usefulness, and importance of something
        * Services
        * Products
    * Service Offering - a formal description of one or more services, designed to address the needs of a target consumer group. A service offering may include goods, access to resources and service actions.
    * A Software example : 
        * POS service
        * Inventory control
        * Payroll  service
        * Customer rewards
* Connecting the Dots : The service value chain
    * 6 key activities : 
        * Plan
        * Improve
        * Engage
        * Design and transition
        * Obtain/Build
        * Deliver and support
    * Common rules of SVC : 
        * All incoming and outgoing interactions to external parties are via engage
        * All new resources are obtained through obtain/build
        * Planning at all levels is via plan
        * Improvements at all levels are initiated and managed via improves
    * Value stream
        * created to carry out a certain task
        * generally responds to a particular situation and organization encounters
        * specific combinations of activities and practices
        * Once designed, subject to continual improvement
    * SVC example

- Practices will reduce both inputs and outputs in the SVC activities
- The exam will not expect you align practices to SVC actives 

Strategic Planning :
